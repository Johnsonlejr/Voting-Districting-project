# Voting-Districting-project

This project is created by a collaboration created by Le Johnson, and Mary Eby.

This project takes a districting of a city and determines possible valid districtings, and opportunity districts for minorities.

Running main_code.py will begin the project. Currently, this project is suited for the city of Seguin, TX. In order
to use this project for other cities, one will need to create an Excel file with each precinct, including the population of the precinct,
the neighboring precincts, and the population of each ethic group in the precinct. The program also needs a seed Excel file, which puts
each precinct into a district. The user can also change the threshold for an opportunity district in the main_code file.
